# cm-chess 

It is like [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js), 
but is an ES6 module and can handle history variants (tree-structured move history).

- It has the same [API as chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md).
- It uses chess.js for move-validation (Thanks for this nice chess-library!)
- It can handle history variants
- It can add Nags, Comments and Annotations
- It is used by the 7000 users from [chessmail](https://www.chessmail.eu) (it works)
