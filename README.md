# cm-chess 

It is like [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js), 
but in ES6 and can handle history variants (tree-structured move history).

- Has the same [API as chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md).
- Uses chess.js for move-validation (Thanks for this nice chess-library!)
- Can handle history variants
- Can add Nags, Comments and Annotations
